# entry point
 main() : type : int and void
# end point
 return 0; error code : 1 and 0 
1 : something aint right
0 : perfect

both will finish but one with error code saying something might be wrong 


code will look like this 

int main (){

    return 0;
}


# what is scope 
restricting some function or workflow within a object

# example
 hey(a, b) {
// you can only access a and b 
} 


# variable declaration
1st method : copy 
= is used to copy 
like 
int x = 5 ;
// 5 will be copied to x ;

2nd method : litral
{} anything inside will be declared without making a copy 

int x{5} ;
